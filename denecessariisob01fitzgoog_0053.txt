is not free hom difficulty, it will be most convenient to give a lull
translation os the most important passage ¹.

‘Now since we have mentioned tallies, consider briefly bow the
cutting of a tally is done. There are two kinds ol tallies, one
called a tally simply, the other called a memoranda tally. The
length ol' the tally, properly so called, is the distance between the
end ol the forefinger and the thumb, when the thumb is stretched
out; and at one end there is a small hole hored. The memoranda
tally, which is always made for payments that are to be blanched,
issomewhat shorter, because aller the assay by which the farm is
blancbed the original memoranda tally is destroyed, and then first
only acquires the length ol a tally when the tally of combustion is
tied to it. The iashlon oi cutting is as follows: A thousand pounds
iscut at the top ol the tally, hy a cut the thickness ol the palm ol
the hand ς then a hundred pounds by a cut the breadth ol the
thumb3 a score οἰ ponnds, the breadth ol the little finger; a single
pound, the width ol a lat barleycorn; a shilling, rather narrower,
yet so that converging cuts remove sorne ol the wood and leave
there a little notch ς a penny is made hya single cut without re·
moving any wood On the edge where the thousand is cut no
other number must be put, saving only the hall ol a thousand, and
this by removing the hall part ol that cut and pulting it lower on·
the tally. Similarly you abah cut a hundred, ll you have no thou·
sands, or a acore ol pounds, or a single pouud. lt you have several
thousands or hundreda or scores to cut, they are to be cut in the
same way3 on the more open edge⁸ ol the same tally, that is, on
the edge which is uppermost when the note is written on the tally,
the larger number must be cut, and the smaller on tlte other edge;
and on the more open edge the highest number is at the top, and
on the less open edge the snallest'nnnher. There is no cut to
signilya mark ol silver; lt is set out in shillings. The mark os

gold is cut lilte a pound, in the middle ol' the tally. Α gold penny ’

is not cut exacdyhte a silver penny, but hy cutting perpendiculsrly
into the tally, not on the slope as is done in the silver penny!

The only effective comment upon this passage is to he obtained
by the actual inspection⁸ ol s tally or ol the pictures in the third
volume ol the Pipe Roll Society's publicatione. lt is,however,
