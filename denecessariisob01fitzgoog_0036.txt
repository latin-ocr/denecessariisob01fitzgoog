24 , INTRODUCTION

The usber has a deputy in the Common 11111011ι and not in the
King's Bench. The marshal, on the other haud, bad his deputies
both in the Excbequer aud in the Kings Beuch ’ς but the marshal
of the Commou Bench was a deputy 01 the marshal of the
Exchequer. Afew words must suffice for the devolution of the
office of usher. From 1156 to 1167 it was held by Roger of
wallingford. His successor was Elias, who scenis to have held
the office as guardian· of the widow aud heirs of Roge13 he
retained the office until 1191, when Laurence, presumably the son
of Roger, 11111111 usher ; and the office continued in the family
of de Scaucario, as it grew to be called, until 1304, when it was
divided between coheiresscs ⁴.

The office 01 usher of the Receipt seems to have become
separated at sometime from that of usher 01 the Exchequer, since
in 18 Edwardl Adam de stratton⁸ held 1 moiety 01 it, which 111
presumably acquired by purchase.

The remaining department of the king's Househuld is that of
theconstables. Their number isnot specified, nor whether, as is
y probable, they served in turn. lf so we may regard the constable
011 duty with 51. 1 day salary as the head of the department, having
under him John, the chief marshal, with 1 salary uf as. a day.
The chief marshal thus holds a position like that of William
Mauduit in the Chambe1‚ or the Keeper 01 the Seal in the Chuncery.
The constables' department includes the wboie outduor staff of
the Huusehold especially those who have to do with horses or
hunting. The marshal has the special duty 01 witnessing all
expenditure by the king's officials, and keeps account by means
01 talliesfdicos) both of payments out of the Treasury and Chamber
and of other expenditure⁸. This right of general supervision may
be the ‘Magisterium in Curia Regis de Liberatione Prebende'
for which John the Marshal owed forty marks 01 silver in
s 3¹ Hen1y1⁷.

In the Exubequer the staff of this department. consiste of the
constable⁸, his 011111’,111(1 the marshal ¹⁰. Their functione in the
Euchequer resemble their functione in the Huusehold. These three
form an independent court for the purpose of paying all soldiers
