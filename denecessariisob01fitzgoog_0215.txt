’ est terra per viros diseretos’ suggests that the author of the

Dialogus held the same, view, though he seems to stop at the

ιε ,division into hundreds. But ‚the division and assessment date

from an unknown periodos history.

4· Inst. ΟΜ· (dated by Liebermann c. 1110) speaks ol the third

penny ol mactet-towns and the third penny of judicial profits as
both falling to the earl. The Dialogus only mentions the third
penny ol the judicial profits. See on this point J. H. Round,
.GeoffrordeMandenille, p. 287. As to the comital manors mentioned
above see Eyton‚ Domesday Studien. Somersel. London1880; and

l. 13. porro vicecomes dicitnr. The history ol ὼε name
‘vicecomes’ belongs to Frankish history. There is no reason to
suppose that normaily in England the ‘vicecomes' was ever the
officer oi ὼε ‘comes' (though special conditions might make
him so, as in Comwall, Chester, Durham‚ and other cases), and
‘vicecomes' is simply the official translation of ‘ Sheriff!

l 16. Numquid ex singulis. The emphasis is on me word
‘singulis'3 ‘are there,' says the scholar, ‘in every county earls
who receive these profitsl' ‘No,' ansvers me master, ‘only these
men (not as Selden ‘these carls') receive them, whom the royal
bounty . . . creates earls, and to whom by reason oi that dignity it
decrees that these sums arcto be granted, whether in see orior
life' The construction is,ol course, difficult; ‘quibus’ seems to
be put ior ‘quos’ because oi ‘conferenda ' in the latter part3 but
the meaning is clear. There is not an earl in every county: but
when there is sn carl. he gets the third penny ‘ratione dignitatis‚'
whether he is an earl in lec or only lor iiie. This is not the view
ol the passage taken by Selden (rnre gs Honour (1672) p. 523),
who has, however„ been misled by a misquotstion oi it by
camden, which he has curiously treated as independent testimony.
Mr. J. H. Round (Geoffryvde Mandant, p. ²93) takes Selden's
