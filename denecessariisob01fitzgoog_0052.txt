The next uae is the ‘auditor's nse,' i.·e.the use oi the Erchequer.
Here the connters are placed in columns, and Recorde points out
that the unite are spread over as many lines as the operator may
find convenient. It may he added that they are placed in tvorovs,
and not more than three in a row. For the penee,a single oounter
above the unita significa td. 3 in the abillings, a single counter
above the unite on the right significa 5, and a single counter on
the leit ro; and the same system applies to the pounds, scores ol
pounde, and so on. We may nov set down aster tbe ‘auditor's
use' thecum offiross res. trd as before :-

lt will be seen, on comperiam, that this scheme almost eractly
coincides with the scheme arrived at hy Mr. Hubert Hali in the
paper referred to above. The evidence of actual use ol this device
is naturally difficult to discover. lt must be sought in the casnsl
use ol it by accountanta, marking the figures nithe counters by
dots on the margins oi accounts. One such instance is mentioned
by Mr. Hall. Another, ol a much earlier date, vill he found in the
Cartulary oi Stanley Ahbey, printed* in the Witsltire Mogarrire,
XV. p.249‚ which probably dates irom the thirteenth century. With·
out insisting that the ‘calculator' os the Drhlogur employed the
‘auditor’s ‚use’ exactly as described by Recorde‚ it may reasonably
be assumed that his ‘acervi numerales' were oi the same nature.

We may nov retum to the earliest arithmetieal device employed
at the Encheqtter, the tally. As the description in the Dahlogus
