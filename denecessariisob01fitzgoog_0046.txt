which subsequently wanted minero were Cornwall. cumberland,
Iancaster (the honour, not the enemy), Nerthumberland Rudand,
Shropshire, Susser'. We may accordingly conclude that no
eounty· aeeounted blanci unless it contained ancient demesne ¹.

Now tbe forms ol money payment recorded in Domesday may
be divided into live groups as follows:

L Payment by tale-‘numeratas' ‘ad nnmerum' or ‘ad
eompottnn'

11 Payment by tale ol' eoina oi sundard might-⁸ de viginti in
ora,' ‘ad numerum de viginti in ora,’ and in a single instance, ‘ad
pondus de viginti in ora' (i. e. twenty te the ounee)⁸.

nt By might-‘pensatas' ‘ad pensum,' ‘ad pensam’ ‘ad
pondus,’ ‘adpeis,' ‘de . . ‚oria' ‘eum pensione· ‘ad pensum regis‚’
aad onec (at Tring in Hertlordshire, which belonged to Count
Enstaee) ‘ad pensum comitis!

IV. By neight in silverol approved finenem-⁶ armset pensatas,'
‘ad usuram et pensum,' ‘ad pensum et mamam: ‘ad pondus et
arsursm‚’ ‘ad pensam et arsuram,r ‘enm pondere et ursione: ‘ad
ignem et ad pensum‚’ together with agronp of apparently equivalent
expressions-‘ albas‚' ‘candidas’ ‘de firma alba,' ‘de albo argento,’
‘blancos’ and ‘blena'

‘de'albis denariis‚' ‘ad numerum de albis denariis'

There ere also payments ‘puri argenti' in Derbyshire, and in
various enunties in gold. In very many cases, ol course, the method
oi payment is not specilied. 'ln four counties, via. Middlesex‚
Shropshire, Cheshire‚ and Nottinghamsbire‚ no information as to

puyment is supplied, and the only information in Sussex relates
to Bosham. ·

On prepuring a chart to'show the distribution ol these methods
ol payment we obtained little fresh information. The most striking
feature is that the payments in Group V are eonfined to lour coun-
ties, via. the lsle ol Wight, Gloueestershire, Herelordshire, and
Cambridgeshire Ol these, all except Heresordshire make payments
