Β “ sor Michaelmas term, ¹⁴ Henry 111, and lor 2850 6r. 8d. ior the
firma of the.year ending Michaelmas, 15 Henry 11, and the
firma remained the same until Michaelmas, 18 Henry II. Census
is clearly applied in this passage to the rents due irorn tenants sor
the term immediately following the taking oi the honour into the
king's hand. The corn (from the demesne manors apparently),
. ‘Bladum manerionrm preter semen,' is accounted ior separately at
aira ror. γά. As this does not appear again, it must be included
in the firmo. Cerasus is also the technical term ior the fined
tribute paid hy exempt monasteries to the Apostolic See. Again,
census is applied to the rent of some lands held in ar Henry 11
by Alcher the huntsman and Richard his son (p. ¹19). The author's
account is clearly inadequate; and in view os the fact that the
census oi many oi the iorests, e. g. Nottingham, Cannoclr, the
Dene, the New Forest and Feckenham, and the wood os Orcop‚
had remained unchanged from 3¹ Henry 1 to ar Henry 11, it
seerrn more reasonable to suppose that a censuris an maessed
or fixed rent as opposed to a firmo which might or might not be
altered. But even this distinction cannot be pressed, since in one
instance (that ol Westbury) the census inor Henry 11 was hall

that received in 31 Henry 1.

a line under it. The usual methods oi altering ancient writings
are: (ι) Erasure (abradere), or seraping the words off the parchment
and either leaving the space blank, filling it up witha line, or
writing the new words over the erasure. (a) Cancellation proper, i. e.
drawinga line through the words to be cancelled (cl. 1. vi. C, below),
or ii the entry is along one drawing cross lines through it. (3)
