¹ INTRODUCTION 11

Henry 11 restored to William Mauduit‚ the younger brother 01
Robert Mauduit, not only the office 01 chamberlain, but also the
castle 01 Porchester, and all 1011111 appendant 10 that office and
castle. This grant, so 101 as the castle 01 Porchester goes, never
1001 effect, but there is abundant evidence that the office 01
Chamberlain returned to the Mauduit family in the person 01
William Mauduit, who was succeeded by his son william, probably
, in 1158¹. This william, the younger, is mentioned as sitting in
the Curia Regis· as Chamberlain at Michaelmas, 1165 ; and first
appears on the Pipe Rolls as chamberlain in1167. The Testa
de Nevr'll' shows another William as still possessed 01 110 office 01
chamberlain and the connected manor 01 Hartley Mauduit

The story 01 110 other chamberlainship is more obscure It
has already been said that in 1130 Geolirey de Clinton held the
other chamberlainship. We bave not been able to connect this
⁸ office with any definite estate during his tenure 0111, nor can
we trace any connexion between him and Warin lita-Gerald, who
appears as Chamberlain with Willlam Mauduit in 1156. suthem
that point the descent 01 110 office is clear, and is associated with
the tenure 01 the manor 01 Sevenhampton in Wiltshire ⁴. Warin
held the office until 1161, and was then succeeded by his brother
Henry, who was succeeded by his son Warin Fitz-Henry in 1174.
Both the lita-Geralds are mentioned on the earlier Pipe Rolls as
receiving money ‘in camera curie’ and we see that the Chamberlain
01 the Household was still closely connected with the Cbamberlain
01 the Excnequers

ln the Ercheqner 01 Receipt almost the whole staff is made
up 01 the deputies 01 the Treasurer and Chamberlains. The former
is represented by a 01011, and the tvo latter by knights, who
receive the usual wages⁸ 01 0 knight, viz. 8111110 The 01011
secures the treasure chest witha sesi, and each knight has a hey; ’
so that all three 010 jointly responsible 101 the custody 01 the
treasure. The 01011 keeps his account in vriting and the knightsl
by tallies, justas in the upper Exchequer. These three efficers Ι
