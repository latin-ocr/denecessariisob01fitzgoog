necessary to observe that no' tally thst we have seen seems to be
cut exactly in the way here described

We may now turn to the actual use ot' the tally, especially as this
point isnowhere dealt with in the Dialogus. An accountant coming
to make his Easter proffer would pay into the Exchequer a certain
amount of money; this amount would be recorded upon a tally in ’
the way described above, and the tally would then be split down

· the middle for about threeqnarters of its length, and part cut off ;

the foll, or smaller part, was then given to the accountant, snd the
noch, or larger part ², retained in the Erchequer. Beyond this,
another usage arose at an early date. The tally became regarded
as a species of currency. If A had paid §ro into the Exchequer‚
receiving a tally for that amount, he might hand his tally over to B,
in whose hands it was equally good for pryment into the Erchequer.
Of course, by this transaction Α left himself without defenoe against
the day of final audit of his account.

We are now in a position to see that, with the aid of the tally
and very simple rolls‚ the whole business of the Exchequer could
be carried on The lay accountsnt aud the lay official would
understand the tally system; the clerks of the Treesury would use
the written rolls The whole business would go on ‘ ad taless’,'
without any need of the more complicated arithmetic of the abacus.
lt is worth noting that the whole of the work on the tallies is under
the care of laymen, while only the clerical official handles the rolls.

As to the date of the introduction of the abacus, nothing can be

’ ssid⁸ beyond the fact thst the Dialogus tells us that tallies were in

use before the abacus But it may be suggested that while the
former device is in use in many cumules, the latter is a specialised
device only employed by skilled calculators, of which the history ls
fairly well known from the time ol Gerbert. While tallies may
bave been in use in England before the Conquest, the abacus is not
likely to have been known there3 und in consequence we ure en·
titled to date its introduction as ocenrring under the Norman
sdmhristrstion. It is worth noting that the word ‘scaccarium'
in the sense of the Court of Accounts, is unknown outside Nor·
mandy‚ England, and countries directly subject to their influence. ,

The examination of the staff, the monetary system, and the arith·
merie being now concluded, it only remainstoformulate the resultso
