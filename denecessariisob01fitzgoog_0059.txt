alive-leot table ir is impossible to suppose that more than three
persons can sit; and ir is therefore necessary to suppose that the
remaining persons¹ sat on the bench but not at the table. It may
be noted that the Bishop os winchester is a newly introduced
official, and that probably beiore his appearance the Justiciar and
the Chaucellor had more room. It will be seen that the sire of the
table adords ample roorn in iront os the various officials sor thern to
work without trenching upon the domain oi the calculator. The
sherid' may appear to be cut alittle short, but it must be remembered
that the §rocoa column was not employed in takinga sherid's
account, and the §noco must have been very rarely employed.

The squarcd part of the table is drawn to show the actual
domain ol the calculator. The seven columns are mentioned in
the Drblogus¹ ; ve have suggested four rows as the utmost reach
of his mm. It is, however, probabie that the squared eloth
extended all over the table.

We may now turn to the actual proceedinga of the court. Ar
the close os each session the preiiminary steps in preparation sor
the next have to be taken. The Treasurer's clerks extract
from the roll of the Exchequer just closed all debts stili re·
maining in charge. The Barons meet (presumably in the
Exchequer Chamber) and decide how much is to be called
up on each of these accounts at the coming aesalon, taking
each county separately. The rolla ol the Justices in Eyre are
produced, and the sums there recorded as due to the king are
assessed in iilre manner. A summons is drawn up addressed to
the shcrid of each county, urgently requiring him to appear at the.
Eaater or Michaelrnas Exchequer, as the ease may be, with his farm
and with the sums thus determined At Easter he must pay the
hall on account, at Michaelmas the whole sum is demanded ol
him ⁸. Besides the debts expressed in the summons the sheriff is
to account lor casud profits accruing to the Crovn. The
summonses are written by the chanceuors scribe ⁴, scaled with
the Great Seal of the Exchequer⁸ and given to the marshal‘, who
debuero them to the usher ol the upper Exchequer', who is
responsible ior delivering them.

¹ The chamberlaine, the marshal, aad the consteble had all ol them dnties
which reqnlre them to riae at any moment For this meson they probably

did not ait at the table.
