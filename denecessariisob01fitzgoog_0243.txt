NOTES 231

quotes a case from the Memoranda ol 39 Heu. 111 (Rot. 9. a)
which illustrates this point. The King on tallaging his demesues
attempted to get a lump sum ol 3,ooo marks from the citizens ol
Inndon, and they offered a,0oo by way oi aid. The King being
dissatisfied attempted to assess the tallage per capita. The case
rdtimately turned on the differeuce between a tallage and an aid,
a distinction which does not appear in the Drirlogus. Again (ibid.
p. 509, note d) he quotes from the Memoranda 40 Hen. 111 rot.
18 b, ‘Ostensum est ex parte Hominum de Bedl'ord‚ quod cum
Homines eiusdem ville talliati siut per capita, Viceoomes iniuste
distringit communitatem predicte ville, ad reddendum tallagiuur
quod assessum est super certas personas: et ideo mandatum est
Vioeoomiti quod de &manda etc. predicte communitati pacem etc. ;
et distringat illos qui talliati sunt per capita? T he oommon liability
oi atoun is always the result ol its own act, not ol that ol the
government.

(Ueber Pseudo-Curet De Foresta, p. 28) compares this passage
with the division ol' classes in the so-called Forest Laws ol Cnut.
He remarks ‘The classilication oi rank ol Pseudo-Cnnt agrees
with tirat oi the time oi Henry 11... . The several classes oi
dependent people‚ irom agricultural tenanta down to slaves, are not
distinguished. As by Richard Fita Nigel and Walter Map‚ the
Villam is classed with the Servus, from whom he is still clearly
distinguished by Domesday in 1086. Pseudo-Cant does not count
the Middle Clusa (sc. mediocres or lessthegnas), as Liderakr just as
Richard does not count the rich Burgesses and tradere, who were
doubtlesa lree, aa Libere?
