or give semarity as in last note.

elsewhere. Cf. 11. 't B above.

l ²7· qnia patens scriptum est. The writ 01 ammons
being sent out open was more exposed to tsmpering. Accordingly
the rule is laid down that no sltemtion in it was permissible, and
any error is not to be conected but obliterated. Even so alteration
was possible, but not alteration to the prejudice nithe debtor.
The object 01 the mle is to prevent the debtor rsising objections to
the amount demanded from him hythe sheriff. See 101 methods

l. rs. rmssmte varo tempore. This increase in the
number 01 the debts was probably duc to the lact that any debts
not recovered were put in charge year aiter year even though there
was no probability 01 their ever being levied. This is srrfficiently
illustrated by the way the Pipe Rolls increased in bulk during the
reign 01 Henry 11. In the twenty-second year it became necessary
toremove the ‘desperate debts' from the roll The same cause led
to the ordinance 01 54 Henry 111 and to the establishment 01 the
‘Exannual Rolls' in 11 Edwardl hythe ‘ Statute 01 1111γι1111011’ (01.
hisdox, Η. Ε. xxiii. 1 1, pp ⁶5⁴ sqq.). Another cause which may
have contributed to the abolition 01 the duplicate summons was the
' sudden enlargement 01 the Pipe Rollin 11 Henry 11, owing to the
number 01 convictions under the ‘ Assize 01 Clarendon' (ree P. R.

rs'rnnry 11, Pipe non society-introducam).
