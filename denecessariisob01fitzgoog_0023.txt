His acquaintance with Seneca, whom he quotes once (Ι. Prol. Α),
is probably only second-hand3 andsomeoithetagswhoseorigin we
have been unable to trace, maybe due to the uae os books oi quotae
tious. His logical expressions, which are not unireqnent, are due

vulgate, which he quotes, especially the Psalms, at every opportunity.

He had read the Insta'tuter3 but sor the Ds'gusthe seems to have
trnsoed to some Summa, or collection oi Brocards. But is we
remember that he was all his lile in the company oi the ioremost
men oi his time, we shall the less hesitate to attribute much oi his
learning to the opportunities thus given to him. The stme he sets
by official tradition accounts at once sor his knowledge and his
misconceptions. Altogether he may he summed up as a man oi
aliana, liberally educated and huowing enough to do hia work
intelligentiy. He is in uo sense a learned man.

Nevertheless two ¹reierences in the Dialogus might seem to show
him in the chmacter oi an author. The Tn'columnb, he says, ‘is
ahoolr which 1 wrote iu my youth, containing the threefold history
of England under Henry 11, and I called it the “Thoumna''
because it was in three columns. In the first column I put matters
concerning the English Church, and some papal bulls3 in the
second column 1 placed the great deeds of the king, which are past
beliei 3 the third column contains many matters, public and private,
aud some legal proceedings. li you can get hold of this book, do
not lose the oppornrnity3 it will be both pleasant and profitable to
students oi the reign! Now thiais the tone oi an elderly man
looking back on a youthiul performance, oi which he is rather
prond. It is, therefore, rather surprising to hear at a later date
that this book conmins an account oi the king's conduct during the
rebellion os his son in 1174 3 which must have been written when
the author was already over forty years oi age, and was just about
to begin the composition oi the Dtbloguu. Attempts have been
made to reconcile the two passages ¹, but the contradiction seems
to us to remain apparent. It is, in lact, inconsistent with the idea
oi a finhhed historical work3 nor indeed has any successisti attempt
been made to identiiy it among the &ordeles that have come down

neomutus.
