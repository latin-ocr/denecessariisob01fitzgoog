Baton Half MS.

Mese are all modern transcripta

We are indebted to Mr, Hubert Hall for giving us a list of these
manuscripts, to which we have only been able to add two, and for

' the description of those which we bave not ourselves examined.

There is one MS. translation-

Bn’tr'slv Marcum, MS. Lansdowne 610, entitled ‘ammo-
nom! This is a translation of the Dialogus by ‘W. B. gent!
A0164y, and has been made from N or some derivative of N.

It begins ‘It is necessary ailwaies to be subject) dac.
“ With these materiale we bave adopted tbe following method of
mnsnucting our text. In orthography we bave been guided by
the Pipe Rolls of Henry IL These records were written under
the eye of the Treasurer and in his language ¹, and may fairly be
taken as representing his standard. As a result we ha've expelled
j from the alphabet, and made use of n at the beginning and u in ·
the middle of words to represent either a or v. In such words
as ‘exitium’ we have preferred tto c, and we have used the single
einatead of the diphthong ae. We have attached no inportance

to the spelling of any of the MSS. Where the reading is doubtful η

we have considered the evidence of N and R combined as slightly
superior to that of C alone3 but in the absence of agreement
between N and R we have almost invariably followed C, and have
considered the agreement ofC with either N or R conclusive
evidence.

We bave been unable to regard certain passages as forming
part of the original argument of the treatise3 our exclusion is
based for the most part on historical or logical incompatibility
between the parts excluded and the rest oi the treatise. Once
a passage in itself suspiciousis variously placed in two of onr three
MSS.; butas a rule the MSS. agree in the insertion of the pas·
sagea we reg-ard as interpolatione. We are not, however, bound
to assume that the archetype of X and C was a copy from the
original MS. with its marginal notes inserted at the points at
which they occurred. We may assume tlre original MS. to have
been completed before April, 1179; the date of R is approximately
rago-1246. We have at most to place two intermediate MSS.
within fifty-two years, and allow tim for the second to become
