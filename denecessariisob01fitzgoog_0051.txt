Ttro things strike one at once: in this system oi arithmetic there
is no aero, and its plaoe is supplied by a system oi columns. Now .
this is the system oi the abacus¹; and to save trouble we shall
in future speek oi tbe exchequer in its arithmetical sense as the
abacus. This distinction between the arithmetic oi the Arabiane
and the system oi the abacus nas proiound. There is in the
Dialogus one allusion to Arabian arithmetic ¹, contrasting it with
the system oi the abacus, but the contrast is obscured by tbe lact
that the only operatione employed in the Exchequer uere those of
addition and subtraction ⁸. It is not needlul to discuss here the
origin and history oi tbe arithmetic oi the abacus ⁴, especially as in
some particulare tbe methodo ol the exobequer were peculiar to
itseli. The earlier abacista seem to bave used pieces, eaob bearing
amarit signisying one oi the nine digito, to place in tbe columns oi
their abacus At tbe Exchequer the calculator employs adevice
known as ‘acervi numerales '3 The nature oi these we shall now
consider ⁸. The earliest description ol the system will be iound in
‘The ground ol Artes, teaching the work and practice ol Arith-
metic‚' published iu 1543 by Robert Recorde. In this book three
methodo oi reckoning by counters are described The iirst system .
deals nith arithmetic oi numbers, and does not conoern us. The
second system is called the ‘merebant’s use‚’ and may be briedy
described. Tbe counters are arranged in tows, the peuce nearest
to the operator3 above them tbe shilliugs, then the pounds, then
scores of pontida, tben hundredo, and so on. For tbe peuce, od.
isindicated by a counter placed above thelim, and the remaining
nnits by counters on the line. For the shillings, ros. is indicated
by a counter above tbe line, 5r. bya counter on the line, but to the
leit band oi the unita, and the units by counters grouped on the
line. The pounds and scores ol pounds are treated in tbe same
