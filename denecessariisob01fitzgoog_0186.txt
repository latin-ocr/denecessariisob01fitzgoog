l. ²3· eumentes illius, ‘for the authority of the third rollis

l. 34. causeris ‘Retracte' are apparently arrears of pay.

aday. At the eud of his account are the words ‘idem vicecomes
debet us. de Retracta liberationis Servientum de Brancmuner!
That is to say he had kept back so much of the sum allowed and
