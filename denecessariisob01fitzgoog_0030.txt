18 INTRODUCTION

the subordinate officere mentioned in this department, some are
, only houeehold servants 3 but among them occurs William Manduit,
who received r4d. a day, and meme to have been permanent only
duty, and certain chamberlaine who received as. a day and served
in rotation. Tbere is also a ‘Tallator Regis,’ who receives his food
and gld. a day for his man; and aChamberlain without salary,
who receives his food only. There is no clear line drawn between
the officere concerned with Honsehold dobes and those who kept
the privy purae, and it is noteworthy that the Treasurer and
Chamberlain appear to rank aa colleagues.

· Before comparing this establishment with that of the Exchequer
oi Henry 11 it is necessary to consider its members a little more
closely. It may be fairly assumed that the ‘Magister Camerarius'
was Aubrey de Ver, to whom the office was granted in fee by
HenryI in succession to Robert Malet¹. In 1130 we find him
with Richard Bassetactingassberiff inelevencounties-Cambridge,
Huntingdon‚ surrey, Esset, Herts, Northampton¹ Iaeicesten Nor·
loll, Suffollr, Buchingham, and Bedsord. We do not as yet
find him acting as treasurer or receiving money in the ‘Camere
Curie¹.' The latter office appears to be performed by william
Mauduit'. The ‘Tallator Regis' may be the Godefridus Tallator
who resided in winchester ⁴, or the Robertus Tailator who had a
woodman at Ehng‘, in the New Forest. ·

It was hom the staff of the Camera⁶ that the principal members
of the Exchequer court were drawn, but the fact that the Exchequer
was both a place for the receipt and payment of money and a court
of account introduces additional complicatione. The officers of
the Camena are not divided between these two functione, but each
officer has his seat in the Court and is represented at the Receipt
by a deputy. The chief officer of the Camers-if it is proper to
call him so-who sits in the Exchequer is the Treasurer ⁷. His

duties in the upper Enchequer are to receive the accounts of the
sheriffs and to dictate the words oi the Pipe Roll. He himself
