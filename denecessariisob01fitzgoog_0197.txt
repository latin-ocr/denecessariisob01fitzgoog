Madox (Hr'rt Exci. ix. l 3. n. (o), p 19³) in which the Sherilis

- of London challenged two successive assays and demanded

a third. ln tbis case (which is quoted from the Communia ci

ἶ Trinity Term on the Memoranda Roll oi 14 Hen. 111) the third

assay was not granted, but the sum paid in was provisionally

,ζ blanched at the rate oi qd. in the fi, although the assays bad given
’ rates oi r4d. and rad respectiver. The question of the third

assay was adjcumed till further order.

j pmge, ‘ignis scilicet ex estuatione,' only repeats those words in

a slightly diliuent iornr. The difficulty is in the words ‘plumbi
inlusione? Probably they had not much more meaning for the
author than they bave ior us. He admits (rirfta, Ι. vi. K) that
he knew little about the process oi aasaying, and he may have
merely wished ιο indicate in a vague way that lead was used in it.
The ways in which silver might be lost in an assay cannot all be
included under the two heads here given Professor H. Louis,
who has been good enough to consider this question ior us,
suggests that the words ‘plumbi inlusione’ refer to the portion oi
the process called by the Germana ‘einuanken,'i.e. the melting
oi the silverio the bath oi molten lead. The passage is alluded
tc in one oi the appendices to the treatise ‘De Moneta’ in the '
Red Book oi the Exchequer (Red Book, p. roco), and is there
paraphrased ‘vel propter nimiam estuationem vel obieri showing
thatthe iourteenthcentury assayer who wrote the note did not
understand ‘plumbi infusione!
