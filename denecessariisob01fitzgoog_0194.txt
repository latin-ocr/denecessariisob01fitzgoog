182 DE SCACCARIO

Underlining ns described in the text, perhaps the most usual form .
of deleting words. (4) Expunging or placing a dot under each
letter to be lest out. (5) Obliteration (cl. 11. ii. B, below), or
blotting out, i. e. covering the whole word or passage with inls as
a press censor ‘ bisks' an objectionable passage in a newspaper.

P. 81, l. 19. in series along the line, not above it as usual.
This rule is not strictly observed, ss will be seen on reference to
the printed Pipe Rolls (cf. P. R. ar Hen. 11, p. rao n, p. 1⁶1 n,
p. 184 n. ΝΒ. The so·called C. R. ol this yearis really the P. R).
It was subsequently renewed in 16 Edward 11, almost in the words
os the Dialogus (Red Book, ed. Hall, iii. p. 858). ‚

l. ar. seriptis patentibus. Here, apparently, as in11.it
Β, C, below, simply a public document Letters patent, as alter-
wards technically distinguished from charters or letters close, were
not differentiated as early as the reign of Henry ΙΙ. For ‘Littere
Patentes’ in another sense, cl. ΙΙ. xxvii. C, below.

l. 31. Oura, labor, studium. Probably an echo of the

κ ‘Epitaphium Senecae’ :-

‘Cura, labor, meritum, sumpti pro munere honores,
Ite, alim post hanc sollicitate animas!
Sen. Opp. ed Haase, iii. p. 482.

P. 82,l. r. breuia regis. The ‘scriptor cancellariae' only
writes the writs ordered to issue by the barons at the Exchequer,
via. those ol ‘liberate ’ or payment, ol ‘computate' or allowance,
and os ‘perdono’ or pardon; the awkward use oi ‘nichilominus'
suggests that the words ‘nichilominus . . . decreuetint' are an aster·
thought.

l. 18. H. rex, etc. The writs printed by Mador (ΗΜ.
Exci„ x, 5 13. note q, p. 268) and Round (Aen. Charters, No. 583
P. R. Soc. vol. ro. p. 96), though no doubt similar to Exchequer
writs of the period, are neither of them attested at the Exchequer,
and must accordingly have been issued from the ‘Curia Regis! ’
Both are write of Liberale.

l. ²3· oportet stiam. The sense ol this passage is as
follows. All writs either ol liberale, or perdono, oroi compuncte
made at the Excbeqner are made in duplicate. The originale
when brought back to the Exchequer by the persons in whose
favour they are issued, remain, if writs of liberate, in the hands
. os the treasurer and chamberlains ns their voucber3 those ol
