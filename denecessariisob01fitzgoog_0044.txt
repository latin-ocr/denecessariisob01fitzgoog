a lixed tarid. If for any reason the paymeuts in kind were in·
sufficient to discharge the eherid's deht, we are leli to suppose tmt
the difference was paid in money. This system lasted until the

. reign of Henry I, when two causes brought about an alteration.

In the first place the king began to require actual coin ; aud in the
next place the burdes of transporting the produce demanded
produced serious complaints. Accordingly a commission was
appointed to examine into the whole question3 the food payments
were replaced by money payments3 the farm charged upon the
sherili was revalued; and it was ordered that hesbould be
responsible for the payment of the whole, aud pay at the Ex·
chequer¹ ad scalam. This last term is explained to imply au extra
payrnent of od. on esch pound to cover any loss that might arise
from the wear nithe eoin. In process of time the wear of the
coinage compelled the introduction of payments ad pnsum, or by
actual weight of sdver'. Fiually Roger of Sababury, when Treasurer,
made the rule that owing to the debased state of the coinage all
silver paid in was tobe tested, and the farm paid in silver of proper
fineuess. This was called payment blancb, and was usual under
Henry 11.

Now it must be observed that the account is completely
traditioual except in one point, vir. where the author appeals to
the fact that entries of payments adseclam and adpendere occur
on the Pipe Rolls of Henryl. Nevertheless the tradition is good
of its kind. Nigel, Bishop of Ely‚ nephew of Roger of Salisbury
and father of our author, was employed in the king's service in
1130 as Treasurer of Normandy⁸, and his evidence would be good
as to the practice under Henry Ι. Richard Pin-Nigel further cites
men whom he has seen himself, who had themselves seen the
provisions brought to the king's court. The period to be bridged
is short-sn. rroo to nn. nilo-only eighty years We must
therefore be caresul not to reJect the story of the Dshlogus without
due consideration.

We may now turn to the other passages in the Dialogus in
which these methods of payment are mentioned The most
striking of these (Ι. ἰν) is remarkable for two reasons. On the one
hand it recognizes that blanch farm goes back to Saron times,
