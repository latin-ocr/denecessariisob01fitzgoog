26 INTRODUCTION

Bohnn family, though it cannot be assumed that at first it was held
by inheritanoe.

The office of marshal¹ during the reign ol Henry 11 was held by·
John the Marshal, whose name frequently occurs on the Pipe Rolls,
and whose presence at the Excheqner is referred to by Fitz-Stephen.
In 3 Henry 11 he is found making certain payments to salconers ⁸,
as described in the Dialogus.

The remaining officers oi the Exchequer cannot be assigned to
any department ol the king’s Household, and may perhaps be re·
¹ garded as speciclly appointed to act in the Exchequer as such It

is particularly remarked that the office ol ‘calculator⁸' ‘nulli
illic residenti convenit ex officio nisi cni Rex vel Iustitia mandaverit
exsequendum‚' though we know that it lell ultimately into the hands
ol the marshal ol the Exchequer ⁴.

Two offices appear to have been created by Henry 11 in addition
to the old stall of the Erchequer, and in neither case does the
Dialogus give us any hint as to the titles borne by their occupante.
The first ol these two, Richard ol llchester‚ Bishop ol winchester,
is described as sitting ‘ex officio quidemsed ex novella constitu·
tione ¹! His duties⁸ seem to consist in assisting the Treasurer in all
his work, especially in the writing ol the roll The office seems not
to have continued l, and perhaps never received any special name.

The other office which was niso created ‘ex novella constitu·
tione⁸' seems also to have been a temporary one. The holder ol
it was Master Thomas Brenn, the hing’s almoner’. His duties
were to wateh and record all prooeedings in the two Exchequers
on the kings behall. He had a staff of two clerks, one sitting
'behind the writer ol the Pipe Roll and kecping a roll, which was
the special property ol his master, and the other in the Receipt
heeping a controlment roll ol issues and receipts in the lower
Exchequer. ¹

The roll kept by him and his clerk in the upper Excheqner
presents some difficulties. The language ol the first passage in
