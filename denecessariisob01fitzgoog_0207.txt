planatiou of the settlement made ,alter the Conquest. Itis not
· historical in form, but rather a legal theory of the history ol the

¹ changes theu made. According to this view all the English land· ¹
,Λ holders who had actually resisted Willism, lost their lands at orrce
and for ever, a statement which facts recorded iu Domesday show
. to be very probable ; those who had not talren part in that resis-
‘ tance (the great maj0rity) remained in possession ol their lands,

but found themselves ruere holders at will under foreign lords with

¹ no inheritable interest Evictions of these precarions tenants pro-

duced a royal decree giving them a new title enforceable against
their lords and recogniaing two classes ol tenure, viz. tenure hy the
favour of the lord, mmb's exigentiae, and tenure undere contract,
stammana pacabne. Now it is clear that this passage is not
applicable to tenams iu chief, and that it does not refer to the
process by which men ‘bought' their lande from William (A. S.
Chronica a⁰ 106⁶): but that it describes the establishnrent of legal
relations between the lord and under-tenant by royal authority.
A close parallel will, however, be found in the famous passage iu
Bracton f. yb, where he discusses, not the condition of English
landowners after the conquest, but that of certain tenants within·
mauors of royal demesne. Bracton tells much the same story;
these tenants, free at the conquest, were ejected by their new
lords‚ restored ina worse condition, and provided by the crown
with a legal remedy. 'Ihese ternanta also were of two kinds, those
who held with a special agreement, and those who had none.
Bracton's account, again, is a legal theory of history rather than
history. The problem suggested by this parallel is double; firstly,
arethe two authors thinking of the same set of facts? and secondly‚
’ was Bracton acquainted with this passage? The second question
is one for commentatore on Bracton; but in answer to the first it
may be pointed out that it is almost incredible that a theory which
Bracton applies to an exceptional class of small holders on the
royal demesne cau be equally applicabis when extended to every
landholder'iu the country. lt may be suggested that the Dablogus
has set out to tell one story and ended by telling another. Another
and apocryphal version of the story will be found in the passage

quoted by Willrins (Leges Angla-Saxom'cae, p. 286) from a mauu· ·

script pedigree of tbe Sharneborne family, subsequently printed by
’ Gibson in bis Reliquiae Spelmanmhnae. Here it is asserted that .
