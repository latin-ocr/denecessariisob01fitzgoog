faras it affecta the question of the origin of the completeExchequer.
ln the case of the staff, it has been shown that the officers of the
Treasury show most signs of a pre-Conquest origin. The monetas-y
system, which is closely bound up with that staff, also leads back to
the same era. On the other hand, the arithmeticos the Exchequer,
like the main portion of the staff of the upper Exchequer, is clearly
of foreign origin As to the dates, or even the process by which
these different elements were united, nothing precise can be said3
but on general grounds it may be affirmcd that the most likely
period for the formation of the Exchequer in its finishedshape is
the reign of Henry1¹.

The Drblogus sifords but little evidence as to the usual place of
session of the Euchequer court during the reign of Henry IL The
soene of the treatise is laid upon the banks of the Thermos, but
there is no evidence to show whether the window¹ where the
master and scholar talked was in westminster, in the Towcr, crin
the New Temple, all places for which claims might be put forward.
We have⁸ in one place a sort of geography of the house of the
Exchequer, where it is explained that there must be a private
chamber for council adjoining the actual house or room where the
Exchequer is held. But the passage does not suggest that any real
building is described, and in fact reads like an account of the kind
of place that must be provided for the court to sit in. There is no
passage in the whole treatise which assigna a definite place to any
of the court's officers mentioned Two places, indeed, are named
(London and Winchester ⁴) as places where the lower Enchequer
might be found And if the passage relating to the tellcrs⁸ is
pressed, it tenda to show that the usual place of sitting was Win-
chester, and tlrat the presence of the Enchequer in London was less ⁸
frequent 3 and to this conclusion we should probably come upon
tbe evidence of that passage. In the second part, however, we find
in the writ of summons‘ spassage where the author might naturally
have mentioned some place as the usual one where the ahcriff would
have to attend. But the words ibi vel ibi obviously show that be
regarded it as quite possible that the Enchequer might sit in any
town in England. And this is confirmed by the passage² which
