to us. Our own view, which we put lorward with some diffidenco,·
is that we ought to see in the Tricolunmr's only the registerbook
ol Richard Fila-Neai, in which he set down anything that interested
him. Such a boolr would probably remain in the Excbequer and
would there periab by use or neglect, asso many Enchequer registers
bave perished The chief difficulty ol this view is the word ‘edidi'
in the first passage quoted above. But no view ol the passages is

lreelrom difficulty, unditisbardtosuppose thatthisbookwasever
poblished in the modern sense ol the word. Probably ‘edidi'
means little more than ‘wrote compiled,' though ‘condidi' would
have been more natural in this senae.

lt hos been objected to this view that the Tricolraemm's as
described seeum to have been rather a literary than an official
composition The ordinary type os official serap-book, it may be

readily granted, does not resemble the Trr‘columm's. But it may
hirly be urged that there is room sor many books between the
extreme types ol the finished chronicle and the casual note-book.
Onr main contention is that the Tn'colummiwas far removed from the
first of drese3 but at the same time in care of selection, in orderli-
ness οἱ arrangement, and even in literary style it may have been
lar above the second. It cannot bave been a continuous ldstorioal
narrative.

In attempting to estimate the credibility ol the Drhlogue de
Scoccorio, the personal character, education, and career os the author
must not be lost sight ol. In matters ol history his own personal
evidence isno doubt good, e. g. when be quotes preoedenntor
Enchequer decisions. His other statements, when their origin

, cannot be distinctly traced, have the value, or rather the vorth-

Manena ol official tradition They cannot be accepted without
corroboration, and sometimes where an independent testis applic-

able (as in his account ol the compiling ol Domesday Book) they
can be shown to bave no near relation to the facts.

signin, in matters of athual practice the author’s position at the
Enchequer renders his evidence conclusive on points ol daily
occurrence, but there are distinct traces ol antiquarianism in bis
descriptions, and it is clear that he osteo describes the Exchequer

officere present, for mannae, must have shown considerable gaps
on many occasions. Where be admittedly digresses beyond his
own sphere his evidence, though valuable,must be received with
