p. 760, where in the account oi the coronation oi Elauer, wife oi
Henry 111, there ir the following note3 Gilbert de Saniord claime
to be the Queen'e chamberlain; ‘he also claimed to have a cierk
in the Exehequer to exact the Queeu's gold, who nhaii take oi the
said guid euch day od. ior hie wages; but the deciaion on this

claim ia put or. And since mentionis here made oi the Queen's ·
gold, note that men have held different opinione on thie maner, 3

his reliei othere that it war from every frne oi roo marks and
upwarda; othere from every fine oi ro marka and upwarda And
although Richnrd the bishop stater this(rcaaiivg⁴recitet’) in his book,
yet it ia ctear that Queen's gold ia due from every fine oi ιο marks
and upwards, for whatever cauae the hue ie made3 this may be
proved by the roll of ιο ]οΙιιι in Berhshire, when tbe abbot os
Reading made fine for 6ο marka....and in theramerollhe
rendere account oid marhe ior the Qneen'e gold! With the
inciusion oi reiieia among the fines from which Queen'a gold was

demanda her gold according to the rechoning oi the tenth part,
and it seems that she ought netto have it save irorn a tine? It
does not appear that Queen's gold was paid upon relieis aiter this
protest.
