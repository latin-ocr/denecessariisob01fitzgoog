INTRODUCTION 45

so iar as the informationes meDthlogus goes, the Treasury, like the
Reoeipt and the upper Enchequer, passed into s ‘vacant interlunar
cave!

Itis useless to endeavour to extract from the Drhlogur, which is
a treatise on the action oi the Exchequer while sitting, insonnation
as to what took place when the Exchequer vas not sitting ς and
sor information as to the site oi the permanent repository oi the
treasure and rolls ol the Exchequer vve must turn to other sources.
The question is briefly this: vvhen the Exchequer ceased to sit,
what vas done with the money and documents that were in the
hands oi the officers?

At a later date the question can be answered. They vere placed
in the treasuries at westminster ¹3 but in me reign oi Heory 11
no such easy solution can be offered Broadly speaking, win-
chester, the capital ol Wessen, the original home ol the Norman
Treasury‚ remained the place ol permanent custody ior both money
and rolls⁸. But, sofar as the money is concemed, there is un·
doubtedly evidence oi the existence ol other treasuries in vhich it
might be placed, and it is quite possible that aiter the Exchequer
had sat at Oxiord, ior instance, both money and rolls might remain
there ior some time, pending their removal to winchester or to the
next place at which the Exchequer might sit Temporarytreasuries³
might, therefore, exist in many places; and the fact that the Ex·
chequer seems to have sat more often at London than at any other
place, excluding winchester, would prepare the way sor the final
removal ol the permanent treasury irom winchester to west· ,
minster. The date oi that removal is uncertain. It may be
coniecturally placed as happening about me end of the reign oi
Henry 11, and as becoming complete during the reign oi
Richard 1.
