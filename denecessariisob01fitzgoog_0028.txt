16 INTRODUCTION

11 the date os the Dialogus the Chaucellor had ceased to be 111-
tinually present ot the sittings 11 the Euchequer ¹, and it is clear
that his duty 11 acting 11 a checlr on the Treasurer might be
deputed to his clerk¹. The holders 11 1111111111 Chanoellor in
the 11111111-1111111111 the reign 11 Heury 11 were Thomas Bechet
(11541161)ωά Ralph de 1111111111(1173-81). From 1161 11

The principa} member 11 the Chancery staff, who attended 11 the
Exchequer by virtue 11 his office, was the ‘clericus qui preest scn'p-
torio⁸.' He is apparently the same officer 11 the one described in the
‘Constitutio' 11 ‘Magister scriptorii? This office clearly grew in
importance during its tenure by Robert de Sigillo in the reign 11
Henry 1. At the Exchequer 111 duties seem not to have been per·

Chaucellor. He watched over the writing of the Pipe Roll and
Chancellor's Roll, and saw that they agreed and that they were
consistent with the Roll 11 the previous year. He also charged the
Sheriff with the debts which were not a part 11 the ‘Corpus Comi·
tatus,’ and was responsible 111 the preparation, the aesling, and the
delivery 11 the summuns in which such debts were recited. Besides
this, he determined the form 11 the wn'ts issucd 11 the Eucheque'r,
and kept duplicates 11 them, though it does not clearly appear that
he scaled them& When he acquired the power 11 taking the
