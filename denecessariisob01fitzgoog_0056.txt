explains thet the sccouutant who is in debt must not leste the
limits oi the town where the Exchequer is sitting ior more than
one day. Moreover‚ we are expressly told¹ that some oi tbe oon·
tents oi the Tressury are moved about in the care ol the Tressurer
and chamberlains, and iollow the Exchequer in its sittings We
may therefore conclude that the home oi the Erebequer wss in
winchester, that it frequently sat in London, but tint it might sit
in any town in the kingdom.

The evidence oi the Pipe Rolls on the point is only indirect, but
the following detes snd plooes seem probable. ln 1156¹ the Ex·
cheqnm sut st Westminster; in 1158¹ one Exchequer session was
held atWorcester; inlrroa‘ one sessionwas atOxlord; ln 1164⁸
the Esster session was at London 3 the Michaelmss session of the

msn ol the Tressury⁰ are officers ol the lower Exchequer. The
Treasury contains the scal ¹⁰, which only leaves it when brought op
from the lower to the upper Exchequer. It also contains ¹¹ certain
chests, which bold Domesday Book and many rolls and tallies need·
iul ior the deily business ol the Exehequer‚ wherever thst may be.
It also is the receptacle ior money paid by occountants ¹¹. In lact,
it is clearly the strong-room ol ὼε Exchequer court, closely attached
to the lower Exchequer, and existing wherever the Exchequer
existed. Moreover, when the sittings oi the Excheouer cessed, the
existence'goi the Treasury was suspended. The watchmsn ¹⁸, like
the other officials oi the lower Escbequer, cessed to be paid, and,
