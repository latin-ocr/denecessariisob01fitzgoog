Ol the great officere ol the household‚ two (the Steward und the
Butler) have no oeats at the Exchequer. But the Chaucellor, the
Treasurer and chamberlain ¹, the Constsble, ond the Marshal ab
appear either in person or by deputy. And these, with other persons
who sat there hythe king's order ¹, were known as thc Barons ol
the Exchequer.

The survival ol this term in the Exchequer until recent years
hus earned lor it au attention which it hardly deserves ln the
Drblogrer itsell the word ‘Baro’ is normally³ applied to the mem·
hers ol' the Court of Exchequer. ln one passage, however (11. xix),
ir is used of all renarro-in-chies, and we may fairly assume that that
is the primary sense ol the word in English records. Any court ol
the iringis normallycomposedol numism-chief, and consequently
any member of such s court is normally a baron Thus the king s
·justices were sometimes known as barons ⁴. The members ol the
House ol Lords and the burgenses os the Ciuqne Ports are still
called barone ; and the occurrence ol the term in the Enchequer is

in like manner a survival from the early organisation oi that court. ’

The nent step in the argument is the comparison oi the organiza-
tion os the king's household under Heury 1³ with the account given
ol the Exchequer under Henry 11.

In the former we find six officers each receiving an allowance
ol five shillings a day. These are the Chaucellor, the Dapileri
or Stewards‚ the Butler, the chamberlain, the Treasurer, and the
Constables.

The Chaucellor appears in the ‘constitutio’ as the head ol
a department, which includes the Keeper of the Seal (or Magriler
Scrr'ptorr‘r) and the hing's chaplaiu. ln the Exchequer his staff
consists of the ‘cleircus qui preest scriptorio,' aclerlr, and a scribe.
Both in the Curia and in the Exchequer he is responsible lor the
seoling ol all writs issued under the Great Seal, ol which sor this
purpose a duplicare· is kept in the Treasury by the Treasurer and
Chamherlains in abag scaled with the Chancellor'sown scal. In
the Exchequer he is, as the heeper of the Chaucellor's Roll, equally
responsible with the Treasurer and Chamherlains for all the pro·
oeedings of the upper Exchequer. There is reason to think thot
