· usurarii disponatur? The Dialogus contradicts-Gianvill as to the
' disposition of the usurer's real property, but the ‘vix' shows that the
. contradiction is not absolute. Cf. Liebermann (Enetum, p. roo),
. who holds tbatGlanvill is right. The making ofthevvill is probably

·' considered not as a condition spart from thet of repentance, but
, only as evidence of repentance, so that the apparent discrepancy

, between Glanvill and the Dzhlogsu must not be pressed. Cf. hovss
, ever below 11.x.1 ‘vita comite poenituerit et testamento oon:

dito,’ dc. But intestacy seems to have been regarded as the natural

. punishment of the siu of usury. Cf. Pollock and Maitlend, ii. 354,
² for the csse of Hamo Biund, ‘who died intestate und is commonly

accused of having lent his money upon nsury! Cluen. Jocelsisi de'
Brakelond (Cumden Soc.) p. 67. Note that making a will is closely
connected with death and the sacrament of penance.. For acconam
of the goods of usurers seized see Mador, H. E. x. § 8, p. 237.

P. 136,1. 21. vel ciuis etiam. Madox's conjecture csieshis ren·
dered certain by the repetition of the phrase in the question of the
scholar immediately following. Clen'csss is 6 tempting conjecture
in both ceses; but probably the sentence is intended to exhaust all
the lay class3 and ‘vel ciuis etiam' only points to· the· fact that
usury in a citizen might be thought a venial offences

P. 137,1. nr. priuilegium demeretur. Cf. Gratisn's Decretum
11. c. 14. qu. 4 for a similar statement

l·²⁴·1²1'¹²d011fib11⁸² i. e. jurisprudents The following passage
might almost be a reminiscente of Glanvili loc. cit.

1. ²9· ecclesis non reclamante: even if the church has
6 claim, she will make none to the goods of an umrer3 it is
doubtful ifthe church had any claim at this date to the goods even
of intestato clerks. But note that the rule is growing up that the
goods of an intestate are to be dealt nith hythe bishop; cf. on
the whole subject Pollock end Maitlund, ii. 354.

P. 1ss,1. 2. more Iudoorum„ A Jev might take usury of
a Christian without breaking any lav of the Chnrch or of the Laud.
A curicus case is quoted by Madox from P. R.4 Ric. 1. rot. 9 6
(H. Ε. vii. 66, p. 166, note u) ⁸ ludas ludens de Bristo debet ii uncias
auri pro inquisitione facienda in Capituio iudeorum si ludens debet
capere usuram 6 ludeo! ‘In eadem specie,’ i. e. the interest must
be of the same nature as the principal; it is not public usury to lend

! money and receive goods in discharge of the debt, whatever the
¹ velue may be.
