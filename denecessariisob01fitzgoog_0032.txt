ao INTRODUCTION

Treasurer. In 1130, however, the office of Chaneellor was held
by Geofirey, afterwards Bishop of Dnrham3 and it is probable that
Geoffrey de Clinton was Treasurer¹ as well as chamberlain.
The Pipe Roll of gr Henry 1⁸ mentions him as paying for the
fministerium thesauri Wintonie' ς and he had also' been engaged
in finaneial business in Normandy in conjunctiora with Robert

Mauduit, the other Chamberlain. 1t might, however, be held that ·

Roger, Bishop of Salisbury‚ remained Treasurer until the date of the
collapsa of the administration under Stephen. lt is probable‚ but
by no means certain, that the first Treasurer oi Henry II was Nigel,
Bishop of Ely; but from 1168* the Treasurer was Nigel's son
Richardthe author of the Dahlngus. The office of Treasurerwasnot
a sery'eanty‚ and was not connected with the possession of any land;
but the two Chamberlains were both hymen, and held their
offiees as sery'eanties. The story of one of these offices ean be
treced with some approach to comptennesst

In Domesday we find a certain william Mauduit in possession
of Porchester⁸ and oi the manor of Hartley Mauduit in Hamp-
“ shire. His son, Robert Mauduit, who presumably inherited these
mauors, was one of the Chamberlains' under Henry 1. He died
about 1129-30‚leavinga daughter and heiress, who ¹was purchased
by william de Pont de l’Arche ⁸, together with her inherited office,
for 1‚ooo marks. At the same time William also acquired for
himself the ‘ministerium camere curie,’ which was probably the
office mentioned in the ‘constitutio’ as held by william Mauduit
the younger, brother of Robert. In this way it might have been
supposed that the whole office would bave passed into the family
of william de Pont de l'Arcbe‚ who certainly exercised the office
in 1129-30', and continued to hold it until after the accession
of Stephen¹⁰. But shortly before his accession we find ¹¹ that
