money payments. Some ol the former still remain, especially
honey payments; but, generally speaking, the firma anain noch's
had been commuted lor a money paynrent. The rents were conse·
quently oerum, and payable at a tired rate in money, or at all
events on a silver basis.

4. Mr. Ronnd has pointed out that the ‘firma comitatus’ was
already in existence in the time ol Edward the Consessor1. The
farm oi Warwickahire, ior instance, was {65 under Edward, with
a boney rent commuted lor §24 8s.; total, §89 tls. Under
William 1 it was ιΕι45, and there were other payments’. The
latter farm included ‘pleas ol the county,’ and thuris strictly
parallel with the farma on the Pipc Rolls.

5. The money used was coined at various provincial ndnts,
most ol tlre counties coining their own money at the county
towns.

The first Pipe Roll, the only roll remaining of the reign ol

'Henry 1, contains striking evidence os the many changes that must
have taken place between the time ol Domeaday and the year ιι 3ο.
The system ol blanch payments is in lull operation in addition to
payments made numero and ad pensum& Comparison ol this roll
with Domeaday suggests, in fact, that what at the first date was an
exceptiontl thing bad then become normal.
· There rs, moreover, some reason ior supposing that ιιι 1¹30
a transition was taking place at the Eachequer between the period
in which farma were pald ad pensum and the period in which they
were pald, at any rate largely, in blanch money ⁴.

There are also traces ol a reorganisation oi the farma ol countr'es,
particularly in the case ol the large group ol counties in the hands
ol Aubrey de Vere and Richard Basset. There had certainly been
a change since Domeaday. Oxiordshire, the Domeaday farm ol
which was ss²49 5s. μ’, with six ‘sextarii' ol honey (worth
about ἐι), now pays more than §332 rgs. rod. The sarm ol

{iarwickshire on the other hand, appears to bave fallen to about
