the edgce οι its leaves had suffered a good deal from wear, it was
again copied into the Black Book (N). The recturent lacunae ln
the Black Book point to a MS. os small siae¹ or else iu double
column. Other indicatione⁸ suggest thet the lines ci the MS.
were short. There was a considerable number ol omissione in
the text cs X, and tbe scribe seems tc bave been in places unin-
telligent ot ll, the original cs C, less can be said There are
few omissione cs importance, and the most striking chamcteristic
is the frequent inversion ol words by which the order cf the text
differs ltom that in N aud R. We have here assumed that X and
Y derive directly from the original text, but oi this there is ol
course no proci, while the agreement ci C, N, and R in tbe insertion
ci certain passages, suspiciously like interpolatione, might suggest
tbe interpositicn ci other MSS. between the original and X and ll.

We may now proceed to describe the MSS. we bave used.

R=Tbe Red Book cl the Excbequer (Kings Remembranoer,
Miscellaneous Bocks, No. a), ff. 31-46. .

Α MS. on parchment, ral‘l x 84⁰, in double columns, rubriceted,
with the initials illuminated alternately in red and blue. The ‘Red
Book' bas always been preserved in the Exchequer as ι book
of authority, and contains various collectione relating to matters
concerning the Exchequer administration. A fuller account of it
will be louud in Mr. Hubert Hall's edition in the Rclls Series,
pp. i-cxlviii The bandwriting is dcted by Mr. Hall in the second
quarter ol the thirteenth century ⁸.

H=Braiaih Murcum, MS. Hargrave 313, ff. a-5 and 16·29.

It has a considerable likeness to R, oi which it is apparently

a contemporary copy. We collated tbis MS. as lar as L v. H,
but as it sbcwed nc truce ci representing any independent authority
we have not recorded its wericus readings ⁴.
