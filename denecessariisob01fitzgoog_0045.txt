INTRODUCTION 33

and adduces the evidence of the country people on the royal
demesnes ‘who have learned from the fathers how much in the
pound they are to pay! On the other hand it contains a passage¹
which makes two misleading assertione: (a) that blanch farm is not

Ἴ ’ mentioned in Domesday, (b) that blanch farm was invented hy

Roger oi Salisbury. This latter passage may we think be salely
rejected as a gloss on literary grounds alone. Its contradiction of
the rest of the Dialogus may be held to confirm that view.

ln another passage ¹, while the assertion that money peid in
hythe eherifi is blanched by assay remuns, we find that the farm
of assandus is blanched hy the profits of the hundred court This,
taken with the passage referred to above, seems to imply that (a)
the tenant paid an extra allowauce for blanching at a tired scale,
(b) that he reconped himself from the profits of the hundred court
when they were grarrted to him 3 otherwise the sttowance was
found by the sherifi from the same source ⁸. ·

We may accordingly say that except for the passage already
rejected the account of blanch farm iu the Dialogus is not
necessarily inconsistent with itself. Turning to the evidence not
contained in the Dialogus, we must first consider that of Domesday

Here the only evidence avallable as to payments isto be found
as a rule in the surveys of the Terra Regii. There are one or·

two triding exceptions, eg. amongst the lands of the Bishop of ⁸

Bayeux, in Count Eustace’s lands in Essex aud Herts andalao in
oertain lands, apparently an eschen, 'ru Nortottr and Suffolk. We
cannot therefore msume that such methods of payment as we lind
there were, or were noh peculiar to the king's laude. lt will also
be notioed that Northumberland, cumberland, Westmoreland, and
Durham do not appear in the Domesday return In Shropshire
and Cheshire the king held no lahds. In Sussex he had Bosham,
which is always accounted for separately, and Rotherfield, which
was land of the Bishop of Bayepx. The land he held between·
Ribble and Mersey was an escheat, and his possessione in
Middlesex were insignihoant It will be observed that the counties
