8 INTRODUCTION

worn or to have otherwise suffered at the edgen Considerlng the
practical character of the book, this is not too much to postulate.
Every early MS. of the treatise is entered in a boolr showing
close connexion vith the Exchequer. It may easily be affirmed,
therefore, that these copies vvere always made by and for Exchequer
officials Copies made under such conditione are at once more
and less accurate than others; more accurate because they are
more intelligently made, less accurate because the copyist is anxium
to include all the informatiorr in the MS. before him, and vill pay

little heed to trivial mistakes and alterations that vill not lead ’

a reader astray in practical use. All the earlier MSS. of the treatise
were probably of the kind here described. At the same time ve do
not vvish tc lay too much strecs on our seclusione, The transitione
of the author's style are often violent and awkward, and his state·
ments are occasionally reclrlessly incorreet. But vve believe that
the passages vve have bracketed exhibit these qualities in an eminent
degree, and are for that reason highly suspicions.

Our dealing with the chapter headings rests on a different
ground. The body of the treatise contains one reference¹ to
a chapter heading, bnt examination will show that if this is anything
but a gloss, it is a reference tc a division of chapters other than
that nov existing. Again, the headings differ in R arrd C, the
only MSS. containing them, and differ also from the contents tables
in the three MSS, which differ among themselves. Moreover, at
the beginning of Book 11 there are marked traces of a different
arrangement of the text Upon such evidence it is difficult to
avoid serious doubt as to the genuineness of the existing divisione.
In order to retain the familiar references to the treatisc ve have
placed the numbers of the chapters on the margin of the text,
but in our arrangement of paragraphs we have paid no heed to
them. The few emendations vre have medeare discussed in their
places ’

The accepted title of the treatise, ‘Dialogus de Scacmdoss seems

to be due to a misunderstanding of the title-page prefixed by Madox
to his edition, but it has nov passed into common use arrd is con·
venient. The author speaks of his book as being ‘de necessariis
observantiis scaccarii! Most catalogues of MSS. use this title, and
add to it the information that Gervase of Tilhury is the author.
