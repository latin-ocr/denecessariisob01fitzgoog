NOTES

Prcr 55, linc r. ordinatiss dao. In this preface the author
is endeavouring to justify the double position of statesman and
ecclesiastic which had marked three generations of his family. His
political philosophy is that of a strong adherent of the hing as
against the conception of a separate secular and ecclesiastica!
state, and he makes use of almost the mine hangrrage and the same
citations as Hugh of Fleury in bis treatiae De regib potestate
(c 1100). All power is from God; thereiooe in serviug Hngs,
the ecclesiastic serves God; kingly power is dependent on dignity,
and on wealth; there may be bad hings, but the judgernent of
their wfekedness is for God; their subjecta must obey them,
and look after their wealth without regarding the use to which it
ia put. The four cardinal virtues are necessary, butneed money .
to suc'ceed. And therefore the author will write on financial
administration, which is the most important part of government
With the views thus stated contrast John of Salisburys satirical
comments (Polycratr'crcs, c. xvii. 677 A, Mlgne) on the practice oi
obtaining clerical preferment by civil employment. ‘Voluit esse
nobilis inter laicos aut certe magnus in clero. Ob hoc principum
virorum quaesivit gratiam, familiaritatem iniit, ab eis quascunque
suscepit functiones. scriniis forte praelatus est, aut consignandi
suscepit officium aut cimelii custodiam, aut publici claves aerarii, '
aut ratiocinii varias cautiones, autsi quid aliud nequit, ut corbibus
praeficeretur, obtinuit! Cf. Rom. xlii. r ‘Omnia anima potestatibus
sublimioribus subdita sit: non est enim potestas nisi a Deo: quae
sutem sunta Deo ordinatae sunt' John of Salisbury (Polycratem,
Mlgne, c. 455 Α) quotes the text ‘omnis potestas a domino Deo
est,' as ‘iilud Salomonis,' referring to the Vulgate (Sap. vi. 4) ‘Data
est a domino potestas vohis!

The form of the preface is of course bonowed from Justinian's
Instrtuter (⁶1mperatoriam maiestatem non solum amris decoratam,
sed etiam legibus oportet esse armatam’ hc.) as is also that of
‘Glanvilh’ ’
