Chancellor's place in sealing all Exchequer writs, he probably
becarrw in fact independent ol the Chancellor‚ and received the
title ol Chaucellor of the Exchequer‚ The date oi this change is
not known, but can be approximately arrived at lrom the following
considerations. Itis certainly later than 14 Henry ΙΙΙ, on the
Close R011¹ot which year is a writ dated Nov. 8, in these words:
‘Rex mittit baronibus de Scaccario Robertum de Sancto Medardo,
clericum, ad scribendum ad scaccarium regis, loco Nicholai de
Nevill, nomine R. Cicestrensis episcopi? 1t is clear from this that
Ralph de Nevill, Bishop oi chichester, the Chaucellor, was at this
date Chancellor also in the Exchequer‚ On the other hand, in
3² Henry 111¹, Ralph ol' Leicester resigned the office ol Chancellor
oi the Exchequer. Forthcoming publicatione will probably settle
the matter past a doubt In the meantime it may be suggested
that aa Henry ΠΙ, when the king took the seal into his own
keeping is a likely date sor the change to have taken place.

The Chancellor's scribe was the immediate subordinate ol the
‘clericus qui preest scriptorio ’ἶ His duties were to copy the
Pipe Roll, while it was being written by the Treasurer’s scribe,
and to write all the writs issued out of the Excheqner by the
Barons, including the summosses for the ensuing term His pay
was 5d. a day* during the session of the Exchequer‚ apparently
the customary wages oi ascribet It may be noted that he is
. the only member of the Chaucellor's staff whose pay is given ·
in the Dablogus. In process os time hc becarm the offieor known
as the ‘Comptroller ol the Pipe!

Passing over the departments of the Steward and Butler, which
are not represented at the Exchequer‚ we come to the Chamber·
lain's department. In the ‘Constitutio' there are two officers
mentioned under this head, each receiving 5s. a day. These are
the ‘Magister Camerarius’ and the Treasurer. The chamberlain is
a constant member ol the Household, while the Treasurer only
receives his allowanoe ‘siin Curia fuerit et servierit in thesauro!
This seems to point to the separation between the Treasury and
the ‘Camers Curie' which we lind at the date ol the Drblogus ⁸. Oi
