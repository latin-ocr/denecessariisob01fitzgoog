a INTRODUCTION

contained in the treatise, with full discussions of many incidental
points, in which will be found some conjectural attempta ιο improve
portione of the text. Most, if not all of these, have been included
in later editions 01 the Select clarere.

The Select claram text, the onerlrfost accessible,1s still substan·
trally the text formed by Madox aad isolmes. But this text rs in

places uncritical and the collatione p'ntrustworthy. For an instance
01 both these faults we pray ⁹·rMer to 11.· ri. Ε, F, where Madox
reads ‘diceres hunc illd inp'ge mitiorem extitisse? with the note
‘.L N exisse! 11010011ιο10 both N and R rs, howevcrst mitius
exisse, 'and the dorr'e’et reading 1s without a doubt‘ mitius egisse!
Here the mistalie· does not effect the sense, but' ιιι the preface to
Part 1,‚Ja the conversion of the‘ mammona’ of thc MSS. into

‘in mrmfcdrdia' has made nonsense of the passage.

..11ιὲ drst object which we proposed to ourselves was the con·
'gamelion 01 a better text than the existing one. An examination
,2'13f the MSS.1 showed that only four of the many in existence were
· likely to be of nae for this purpose. Of these four the MS.
known aa Hargrave 3¹3 was found to be only an incorrect tran·
script of that ιιι the Red Book, without any trace of an independent
source. 'Ihe three remaining nere the Red Book of the Excheqner,
bere called R; the Black Book 01 the Excheqner, here called N;
and the Cotton MS. Cleopatra Α 16, here called C. It speedily
· bccarm clear that none of these three was the original, and that
in all probability none was even copied from it. It was also clear
that R and N were copied from a common original, which was
not the original 01 C. Comparison of R and N showed further
that their common original omitted certain passages which existed
in the original of C3 moreover, the signs of uncertainty shown
in the MSS. as to the proper order of the words in many pas·
sagea suggested that interlineations or marginal notes had
been differently interpreted by the two unknown originale. Con·
siderations of thia kind led us to the conclusion that the history
of the MSS. before us was probably the following. From the
origirnl text of Richard Pin-Neal two copies, which wc will call
X and v, arose. X, while in a good condition, was copied into
the Red Book of the Exchequer in the first half 01 the thirtccnth
century, and at a later date, at the end of the same century, when

the results 01 hia stndy of the MSS. 01 the Dialogus.
