19. aptus. It must not be supposed that the Sheriff rau
any risk 11 being executed. He would probably, when caught, be
committed to the Fleet, until he fined vids the Klng lor his
ielease. In the filleenth century the Sheriff 11 Northumberland
frequently does not appear 111 years successively. Possibly the
author is thinking 11 the use ol ‘caput' in the Civil law. 01
course the offence was technically rebellion. Casca illustrating
the actual practice are quoted by Madox (H. 1111111. i 11, pp.

In this last case the Sherlff was fined 17 ron—which would suggest
that he was a day and a half late. Similarly on the Pipe Roll 11
1 Ric.I (Καί, p. 232) we lind Alan de valoines, Sheriff 11 Kent,
fined §65 111 being thirteen days late (cl. Madox, H. E. xxiii. 5 11,
p. 695) This seems to show that the more mercisul course was
adopted in actual practice. For the later rule, see L. Τ. R. Memor-
anda Roll‚ 40 and 41 Henry III ahter Recorda quoted by Madox,
·H. Ε. xxiii. 5 1, p. 644, nsi It will be seen that for the first four
days the fine was then rated at 15 per day ; after that it was at the
Klng’s discretion Before the order 11 41 Henryllllas 1111 some

leq years later) the fine was fixed at §5 lor the first three days
