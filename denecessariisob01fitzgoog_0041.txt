needed, or more. In either case a pound by tale (ie. ²40 peuce)
was placed in a cup to be assayed‚ while the remaining twenty-four
sbillings were returned to the purae. The melter received bislee ’
of ad, and two sberids were appointed to accompany the sheriff
whose mone'y was under examinatius and act as witnesses. The
pesotu and the three sheriffs then went to the furnace, where the
melter awaited thena The coins were recounted, first by the
pesour and then by the melter, who proceeded to assay them. Aa
the description of the process is conlusing, a lull translationis bere
given: Δ

‘The melter takes the coins in his own hand, counts them and
arranges thern in acupel, or test ol wood ashes (vasculum rgnt'lorum
alanum), which is in the furnace He then reduces them to an
ingot (mnsam) according to the rules of the melter's art, melting
and pudlying the silver. But he must be careiul not to stop before
the process is complete, nor to ver and consume the adver by
uuneccssary beat3 since, in the former case the king, in the latter
the sherili, would lose. He must take every care and exercise all
diligeuce that the adver be not consumed‚ but only thoroughly
refined by heat (ad purum excoquatur); those who are sent by the
Court must give heed to this same point. Now, when the test-
piece is made, the pesour takes it to the barons, accompanied by

· the others, and weighs it before all their eyes against the pound

weight mentioned above: he proceeds to supply what the lire bas
cousumed by adding pieces out oi the purse until the test-piene
balances the pound weight Then the test-pieoe is marked with
chalk with these words, “Yorlrshire. The pound burnt so many or
so many pence‚'' and then it is called an ‘¹ assay,” ior it is not marked
until it has been admitted that it should he so marked But il the
shedff whose assay it is challenges it on the grourm that an undue
quantity lias been consumed [rc. by overheating or by the melting
ol the silver into the lead], or if the melter admits that for some
reason the test has failed, twenty shillings are once more to be
cmmted out from the remalnder in the purse, so that the test may
he repeated as before! Agaiu¹r ‘As long as a certain black cloud
is seen hosting about on the suriace nithe molten silver the test is
considered incomplete. But when certain minute grains, as it were,
are brought up from the bottom to the top and there dissolved, it is
a sign that the process is finished!
