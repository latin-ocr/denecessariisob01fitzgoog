Noue ol the four earliest MSS. has any contemporary title cr any
hintastothe author'sname. ,

It isnot easy to understand bow thistreatise carm to be attributed
to Gerwase ol Tilbury. Madox (p. vii) only tells us that it had
passed under that name ior many years, for what reason he did not
know. He proceeds to show that Gervase of Tilbury cannot be
identified with Gervase de Thesauro, who was an officer of the
Receipt of the Exchequer in the early years of Henry IL Itis,
however, improbable that the mistalre arose from any such
identification or confusion. The most probable explanation is that
the work called Trr'columm‘s, which the author cf the Dialogus·
speaks cf as bis own, bas in some way been confused with the
Historia Traepartifa of Gervase of Tilbury. But even so slcnder a
thread of connexion is scarcely necessary. Coke (Ft'rstfmtp 13),
who quotes the Drblogm repeatedly, refers tc the author as ‘Oetam'
Now as Coie knew the date of the tractim, and ought to have
hnovm the date of William of Ockbam, it was a bad blunder to
bave confused the two. Supposing Coke to be merely quoting the
title of the MS. which he used, we must regard the original
attribution of that MS. as purely arbitrary. It would be possible
to quote instantes from the history cf English MSS. of equally
uuwarranted fatheriug of books on famous names.

But there is no difficulty ἱππ assigning the treatim to its true
author, and Madox hes the credit of first establishing the fact that
the writer of the treatise was Richard, Bishop of London, basing
his argument upon the assertion of Alexander de Swereford in the
Red Book cf the Excbequer ¹. It is not intended in this introduc·
tion to deal at length with the life cf the author. It is sufficient to
point out that Richard was the son² of Nigei, Bishop cf Ely, who
was himself the nepbew or son cf Roget, Bishcp ol Salisbury, and
the brother cl Alexander, Bishcp of Lincoln. All these men
belonged at cuce to the hierarchy of the Church and ol tbe
administration. hs a member of the family, proud of their name⁸,
the repository of ,an iuherited knowledge ⁴, it was natural that be
should wisb, like bis father, whom he calls the Esdras cf the
