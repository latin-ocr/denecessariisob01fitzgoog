delectu' In thesauro iiis. et dehet xxxviiis! The payments ol
the current year are the ‘noua placita' and follow the ‘placita' or
arrears.

Ρ. 142, 1. 4. Placita autem the distinction here drawn is that
‘placita’ are penalties, ‘conuentiones' voluntary payments made to
the Kingto secure some advantage. But there are many payments
that lie upon the berder line; the peculiar position oi relies is dealt
with in 11. xxiv, below; and it may be added that it would be
difficult to say whether a fine ior leave to compromise a suit vvas a
penalty or a voluntary payment, were it not that the payment oi
Queen's gold upon such lines puts it among the ⁴ sponte oblata'
The same difficulty occurs in the case os fines arising irom amerce·
ments. See Medon, H. E. xi.-xiv.

of payments assessed on individuale (angulorum) the sheriil is only
(solum) responsible ior enlorcing payment, and so does not get the

P.1sa,t11. Eritne vera No reason is here assigned ior
the nse oi the phrase ‘per breue regis' instead of ‘per cartam
