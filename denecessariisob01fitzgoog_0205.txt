is clear that if enough subtenants had not been enfeolfed, the
Ι chief lord would have to hire soldiers to perform his servioe; and

in the case of ecclesiastical liefs there was always a doubt whether

’ their holders were bound to serve the king except in defence of

the realm. 'Ihese two difficulties seem to have formed the point
of departure for a system, whereby the lord, instead ol performing
bis service, pald to the ltinga commutation for it In the case of
ecclesiastical tiefs this procedure ean be traced as early as the
year 11093 in the case of lay fiefs the evidence does not carry us
· earlier thart the year 1159. See Feudol Englaad by J. H. Round,

hy Madox on this statement in his note we quote from the Pipe
Roll of 18 Heu. 11 the names of the following exchequer officers
exempted ‘per breue Regis' in that year: John the Marshal
(p. 15), Ranulf Glanvill (p. gr), Henry Frta Gereld (p. 44), Richard
de Luci (p. 140). Most of these names recur.

l. 7. Eurorum. The history and administration of the
‘murder-line' are obscure. The Exchequer theory at the date
of the Dialogus was that for every homicide done secretly, so
that the perpetrator was undiscovered, the hundred was liable to
atine of §36 or 244 to the lting; that this was introduced by
William the Conqueror to put a stop to the frequent ‘murders’ ol
Normans aller the oonquest; that originally only ‘murders' of
Nonnans were so punished, but that the gradual fusion of the
two raoes had made this distinction almost impossible except in
the ease of men of unfree status. In several points this accountis
incredible, but it is difficult to construet a tenable theory .in its
place. If we tum to earlier authorities on the subject, such as the
Leges Edworde'Confesrorri,15, 16, Leges Wt'llelmr', 1. aa, 111. 3,
and the Leges Henrici xnt a, LXXV. 7, XCI and XCII, we liud
details not mentioned in the Deblogar to as the liubilityof the town-
ship, or the lord, whose man the murdered person was, or in some
cases the chattels of the house where his body was found, the
hundred sometimes being only liable to melre up the deficiency;
there are also statements as to the rights of the ltinsmen, and ·
ageneral agreement that the amount of the line was sorry-six marks
ol silver. If from these doubtful and differing authorities we
turn to the Pipe Rolls we find, liratly, that the line is always levied
