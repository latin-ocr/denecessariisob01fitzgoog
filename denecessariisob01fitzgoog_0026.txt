Domus Regis¹’ (c. 1135), and examine the organisation revealed in
that difficult document5 we shall compare it with the organisation
01 the Exchequer as given in the Dialogus, and thus show that, with
a lew exceptione, every important officer in the finmcial depart-
ment has his place also in the household. It may be added, that the
constitution 01 the household is so clearly 01 Franlrish origin that it
is not possible even to doubt that its organization was originally
imported from ·abr0ad¹.

Before coming to the details 01 each office it is neediul to maire
abriei study 01 the iinancial department as a whole. The first
characteristic 01 11 is its double nature. In it one office is super·
imposed upon anathem there is au upper Exehequer and a lower.
This lower Enchequeris concerned with the payment and receipt
01 money, and at its head stood the Treasurer and chamberlaine,
to whom all write dealing with these matters were addressed. The
actual work 01 the lower Exchequer was pertonued by deputies 01
these officere, but the responsihility was upon the Treasurer and
Chamberlains themselves. It is possible that the lower Excheqner
and the Treasury‚ which is closely connected with it, are the actua}
successore 01 the Treasury 01 the Angla-Sason period; at any rate,
its stati can be traeed baclr to the Conquest.

The upper Erchequer was a court 01 account, 01 which the
Treasurer and (Jhamberlains were members, bnt which contained
many other officere having no connexion with the Treasury. It is
simply the lring's court 101 matters 01 finanoe. 'The king himself
might, and sometimes did, preside ⁸. Certain great officers always
sat there, but the king might order other persons todo so by his
special mandate Libe other courts, it had its records; and, in
lact, the more we think 01 the Treasury as an office in the modern
sense, the nearer we shall be to comprehending its action; and the
more we think 01 the upper Enchequer as a court, the more nearly
right shall we be on that side.

First 01 the officers constituting the court came the· Justiciar.
He appears simply as the king’s representative, and as the head 01
either the Curia Regis or the Exchequer in the iring's absence.
Robert, Earl 01 Leicester⁴‚ and alter him Richard de Luey, held
this office during the first two-thirds 01 the reign 01 Henry 11 ¹
