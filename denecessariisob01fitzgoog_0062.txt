peualties lor breaking the law, cr so-cslled voluntary payments
made to the king with the object either cl obtaining some cou-
mesico, or ol escaping some punishment The former may be
called amercements‚ the latter lines. Reliels, or the sums paid by
heire tc be allowed tc have possession cf their landa, cannot
convenientiy be clasaed under either os these beads ¹. On all fines
a payment of 9 per cent is made to the queen, whose clerk attende
in the Exchequer to receive it ⁸. These amercenrenta fines, and
reliels are collected upon the report ol the Justices in Eyre, and the
account is subdivided into uectium according to the eyres in which
the debts were esseesed ⁸. The debts essessed by the central ecurt
sitting at the Exchequer have a section to themselves ⁴, aud the
most recent amercements and fines come under the heading

last becatm they cannot be formally demanded, but depend cn the

The account of the sherifl’s farm can now be completed ⁸. 'For
this purpose all the members cl the court are called together: the
sum paid in by the sheriff (cr what is lelt of it after the mtisiacticn

oi the other accounts) is set out in counters cn the table. The
sum to be deducted for blanching is calculated at the rate deter-

mined by the aasay. The tally for the payment made at Ecstor·
is produced, with its combustiou tally attached. The sum cs the
two blanch payments is added up and recorded on oue telly, tc
which another smaller tally is attached showing the amount de·
ducted for blanching. The sheriff is only credited with the amount
expressed iu the larger tally, but the Treasurer is accountable lor
the sum οἰ the two. The total with which the eheriff is credited
mmains set out in a pattern of counters cn the Exchequer table.
