NOTES 237

as in th'e case ol ‘pene pecuniane’3 they resemble tbe ‘sponte
oblata' in that Queen’s gold was payable upon them ς but compare

c. xxvi. below. Note, however, that in practice the King would
seire the estate until the heir gave him security lor the payment oi .

leave might when discovered be compelled to account lor all the
issues ol the estate during his irregular possession.

P. 156, l. 4. accipitres scillcet vel falcones. ‘Accipiter' is
probably used here as a classiml equivalent ior ‘falco' although
the latter word occurs in Servius and Isidore3 otherwise ‘accipiter'
must be taken to mean s tiercel. ot the sanctiss mentioned ‘Nor-
rensis' is presumably the Norwegisn gersalcon, ‘Hibernensis' may

, be the peregrine, and ‘Hispanensis' the Barbsry falcon or perhaps
the Saksr. There seems to be no mention ol the Gosbawk‚ which
is usually rendered by ‘Asturcus' The Hon. Gerald Lascelles
(Fabam, Badmshion Lr'brary) gives the moulting period as April
cr May to August for Eyesses, and July cr August to February ior
Passege Falcone: which would seem to show thet the birds were
taken from their nests and not 'caught when lull grown. ‘Hornus'
sor ahawlt in its first plumage is clearly an expedient to avoid
using the mediaeval Latin ‘sorus ’..-.‘ soer' or ‘red'
