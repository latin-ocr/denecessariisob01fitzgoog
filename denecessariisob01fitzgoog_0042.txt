No payment was made to the melter sor repeating the test ¹, and
the test-pieoes, when done with, were put by to be used ior making
silver plate, or ior coinage ior use abroad 4.

Two serious difficulties arise in oonnexion with this account, and
throw grave doubts on its accuracy. ln the first place, the only
mention oi the nse ol lead is in tbe passage agnis salutet ex estao-
tr'om nel plumbi abfuerim, and this passage, though supported by
all tbe Mss, has the form oi a gloss. Furtbermore, it is very
difficolt to understand 4. The use ol an ash test, or cupel, instead
ol anordinary crucible, does indeed imply that lead was used⁴; but
it seems clear that Richard the Treasurer bad no idea ol the reason
ior its use, and consequently attached no importance to its presence.
He was, however, confessedly ignorant os metallurgy 4, and even
slrilled metallurgists ol a later date are inclined to regard the lead
as merely protecting the silver lrom volatilination 4. Moreover, the
test ol the completion oi the process quoted above is consonant
with the view that cupellation was employed, since it may well refer
to the pbenomenon known as ‘brightening' We may probably,
therefore, assume that the difficulties os the passage are solely due
to the ignoranoe oi the author. In the second place, it will be
observed that the test-piene, as it leaves the melter's hands, is
assumed to be pure silver. Consequently, ii the account in the
Dialogus were correct, blancb payments would have been made on
apure silver basis; that is to say, the sberiff would only have been
credited with tbe weight oi pure silver actually pald in. There is
no mention oi any allownnoe being made lor alloy.

Now the account os the origin oi blanching given in the
Dablagas' implies that the process was intended only to guard
against wear oi the coin, clipping, and false coining⁸ ; that is to say,
that tbe steriffs payment was reduced from its current value to its
value in standard silver. We must conclude that the author oi the
Dz‘alogan regarded the standard silver as being pure silver 4. iteam
however, be shown that this was not the case. Actual analysis of
the coins leads to the conclusion that the ‘old standard oi England'
