INTRODUCTION 23

melter3 but it appears that William the Melter, who died about
4 Richard 1, had lsnds ¹. There is a Richard Fundor named in
the Pipe Roll οἰ 3 Henry 11¹, and a Gilbert Fusor occurs in
26 chry 11⁸, bnt he may have been employed in the recoinage
ol 1180, and notin the Exchequer. In ²4 Henry ΙΙΙ, Otes, son
ol John the Melter, sold the seq'eanty to Edward, sonos Otes the

· Goldsmith, apparently a member oi the well-known family ol

hita-Otho, which beld tbe office ol cutter oi the dies. And in
13 Edward 1 the king purchased the office from Otes ol' west·
minster, possibly the representative of that Edward‘.

The usher os the Exchequer and the usher ol' the Recelpt may
most conveniently be discussed as one officer. The Dialogus is

not indeed explicit upon this point 3 but there is reason to think⁵ Ι

that the usher ol the Reoeipt serves in the name of the usher ol the
Erchequer. The passage· in which the treatise states him to be
the servant ol the Treasurer and chamberlaine is not inconsistent
with this view. But it can be shown from other sources that the

ushers ol the Reoeipt and ol the Exchequer were only another Ι

instance os a duplicatcd office. Roger os Wallinglord, who is
mentioned as ‘aedanus Thesaufi²¹ in a Henry 11, received the
‘Magistratus Hostierie de Scaccarr'o' by a charter', whichis dated by
Mr. Eyton as about Michaelmas in that year. Assuming, therefore,
tha we are only dealing with one office in two different places, ·
it may be pointed out that we have here an old offioe belonging
to the original stall oi the Treasury and Chamber. Like the
offioes oi the Chamherlains, the weigher, and the melter, it was
a serjeanty; and was connected with the manor ol Aston Rowant‘
(Estone) in Oxlordshire, which is mentioned in Domesday among
the ‘Terre Ricardi et aliorum ministrorum regis? Both ln the
‘Constitutio ¹⁰' andin the Dr'alogus ¹¹ there is an apparent connexion
between the offices os the usher and the marshal. But closer
inspection makes it probable that the usher is primarily an officer
of the Treasnry, and'not like the marchas an officer of the Curia.
