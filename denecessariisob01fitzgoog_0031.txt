examines the sheriff as to the ‘Corpus Comitatus,’ just as the
Chancellor’s clerk examines him as to the estreats¹. He ia per-
sonally responsible both ior all that is done in the upper Exchequer
and ior the receipts and paymenta in the Excbequer oi Receipt,
where he bas bis deputy. But thie responsibility is shared in both
branches oi the Excbeqner by the two chamberlaine, who are tbe
Treasurer's close colleagues⁸. Their personal duties in the upper
Excheqner do not seem to extend beyond sbaring the Treasurer's
responsibility. They aleo have their deputies in the Receipt.

The remaining officer os this department in the upper Exchequer
istbe subordinate oi the Chamberlnins, the cleric or aery‘eant ubo
produces the counterioils oi the tallies bened in the Receipt and
cun new tallies, or alters theold ones as the accounts oi the
sheriffs may demand It will be seen that aa the writing oi the
roll ia the peculiar duty oi the Treasurer, who was a clerk, so
the cutting oi the tallies devolves on the Chamberlaine‚ who were
lay barons3 and the same division oi labour will be found in the
Receipt.

A consideration oi the persons who occupied these posts in
the reigns oi Henry I and the earlier part oi that oi Henry 11
will illustrate tbe close connexion between the 'Camers Curie'and
this branch oi the Court oi Excbequer. But beiore entering upon
the details os this subject a iew preliminary difficulties must be
stated First, the authorities at our disposal do not discriminate
between tbe Exchequer stalis of England and Normandy ⁸. A man
may be mentioned simply as Treasurer, and no added word shows
whether be is Treasurer oi England or oi Normandy. Next the
word ‘chamberlain' ie very loosely used, being sometimes applied
to persons who bave clearly no connexion with the Exchequen
Many oi our problema turn upon difficult questions oi genealogy,
and, as will appear, there are other stnmbling-blocha

As to the Treasurer: it is not clear who held thia office under
Henry L According to William of Malmesbury ⁴, Roger, Bishop
oi Selisbury, combined the dnties oi Justiciar, Cbancellor, and
