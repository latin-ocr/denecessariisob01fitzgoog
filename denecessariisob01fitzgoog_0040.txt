In fine, it nppeers that the Exchequer ol Henry 11 oonsists oi
the ‘Curis' imposed upon tbe ‘Treesury' ss n court os control;
thet the Treesury is the older ol the two, end shows signs ol pre·
Normsn origin.

TheTreasurysnditsstsfftppeertobe theesrliest portion oi
the Exchequer; and it may be added thet no pert ol the Trensury
staff seems more primitive than thst connected with the farm oi the
eounty eud the method oi its peyment'. As is well known, in the
msj0rity of the English enunties the vnrious ennunl sums due to the
bingas the inrum oi his demesne menore, together with the esti·
msted yield oi the ‘ plens oi the county,’ were stated es n lump

aprocess reeently introduced, we ere entitled to suppose that the
process of blanching the sarm ol the county wss oi some antiquity
even in the earlier pert ol the twelstb century.

The system adopted was, shortly, es follows: The tellers in the
Reeeipt set aeide sorry-four shillings by tsle sor the assay' in spurce
to which the sheriff set his sesi. On the day of the essey this
purse wss brought into the upper Exehequer by the pesour (attus
