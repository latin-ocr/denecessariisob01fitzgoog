INTRODUCTION 27

which it is mentioned suggests that it was an aectrrate copy oi
the Pipe and Chancellor's Rolls. In the second passage it 'rr

described in grandiloquent terms as containing ‘iura regni regisque
secreta! The two descriptions seem incompatible‚ and we do not
see how to reconcile them.

It has been remarked above that the appointment of Thomas
Brown was a purely personal one‚· no successor to him is known,
and no trace remains oi his roll or ol that kept by his clerlr in the
lower Exchequer.· But there is reason to think that in iorrn and
iunction he is represented in the final form os the Erchequer.
The Ktngt s Remembrancer seems, in later times, to have done very
rnuch what he did; and though there is no clear continuity between
the offices, the great lilreness between thern is worth noting. In
the same way the iunctione oi the clerk in the lower Exchequer
are at a later date performed by the Auditor ol the Receipt Here
again there is no stated continuity oi office, only a similan'ty in
iunctior.

The statements oi the Dialogus-¹ as to the payment oi the Ex-
chequer staff are confirmed by the lssue Roll oi 9 Henry 111,
quoted by Mador ⁸. lt will be ohserred that these customary pay·
ments are only made while the Exchequer sits, and that the Reoeipt
cannot therefore be regarded as a permanent department ⁸, hut
merely as a branch oi the Court oi Exchequer. Further‚ with the
exception of the Chancellors scribe, all those who have payments
out oi the Treasury are inferior officials oi the Treasury staff.
Some oi them undoubtedly acted on Exchequer business while the
Exehequer was not sitting ⁴, and in such cases were specially paid
by orders on aceonnants. The other members oi the court pre-
sumably had fixed allowances as members ol the Household, payable
by the ⁸ Camers Curie‚’ or else were paid by the persons on whose
behali they acted. We know at least that under HenryI the Chan-
oellor had his 55. aday⁸ while sitting at the Exchequer‚ but it does
not appear how that salary was normally paid. With regard to
those persons who mosthene had duties at the Tressury when the
Exchequer was closed, such as the deputy-ehamberlains, the usher,
and probably the watchman, it may be suggested that those who
held serjeanties had no other allowance ior their duties at the
