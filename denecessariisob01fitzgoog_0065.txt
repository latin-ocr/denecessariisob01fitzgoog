Treasury both by writ¹ and without ⁸. Consequently, a Commis-
sion was appointed lrotn timeto tinne totale account ol all
receipts and iesues of the Treasury⁸. On this account it was
necessary to have tallies both lor the sums received on account ol
blanehing‘ and lor payments out made without writ An instance
os this is alluded to in the Pipe Roll ol 3¹ Henry 1, when the Earl
os Glouoester and Briau Flu-Coun took the accounts ol the
Treasury of Winchester⁶3 and at a later date the Bishpp ol
Carlisle obtained a charter from Henry 111 that his executore
should not bc impeded in carrying out his will by reason ol any
such account due from him ⁸. But all this is external to the
ordinary Exchequer business, and therefore does not appear on
the Pipe Rolls, witich only exhibit the linancial relations betwixt the
Treasurer and the accountants τ; and sor the same reason it is not
directly treated os in the Dialogus.

Such, in brief, was the system by which the money owing to the
king throughout the country was collected and accounted sor. For

further details ol its administration we must refer the reader to the
printed Pipe Rolls and to Madox’s chtory pf tlte Excltequer.
