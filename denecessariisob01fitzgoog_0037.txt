and all persons connected with hawlrs and hounds who come to
the Exchequer ior their weges. The duty oi attesting writs sor
payments ont of the Treasury here nominally falls to the constable,
but it is clear that he aeidum, it ever, executed that duty ¹.

The constable’s clerlr also performed his duties by deputy'.
He cannot be identified clearly with any officer named in the

‘Constitutio Domus Regis'3 in the Erchequer his special iunc-
tion is to attend with the duplicates of the write issued in the
Curia.

The marshal in the Enchequer has tbe custody oi the vouchers

to be served. Originally the marshal oi England performed these
duties in person ⁸, but alterwards they fell into the hands oi a cleric,
like the clerlr oi the constable3 and both these clerks continued to
officiale until the iourteenth century ⁴.

The succession oi the office os constable is obscure ⁸. Ulti-
mately it becarrm hereditary in the family oi the Bohuns, ailerwards

the well-known Henry de Esses, who iorieited the office in 1163,
when vanquished in the judicial contest at Resding. The nent
holder os the office was Humphrey de Bohun, who seems to have
obtained it soon aiter coming oi age in 1174⁴. It is possible that
his appointment was due to his relationship to Miles oi Gloucester,
who had been one oi Stephen's constables, and on quarrelling with
Stephen became the constable oi the Empress Maud. At the same
time, Humphrey cannot have inherited the office of constable, or
even the ‘honor constabularie,' from Miles, since neither Roger nor
Walter oi Hereiord, the sons oi Miles, appear as constables in the
reign oi Henry 11 ⁷. As has been said, the office continued in the
